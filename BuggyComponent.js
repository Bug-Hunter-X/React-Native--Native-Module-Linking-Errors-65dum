This error occurs when using a library that requires native modules and the native modules are not correctly linked or installed.  This often manifests as an error like `Unable to resolve module`, `Invariant Violation: requireNativeComponent: `ComponentName` was not found`, or similar messages.  The root cause might be an incorrect setup in your Android or iOS project, or a mismatch between the library's native dependencies and your environment.
